# The 2048 game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. 
The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. 
However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.

## Gameplay

2048 is played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.
Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. 
If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. 
The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow.

A scoreboard on the upper-right keeps track of the user's score. 
The user's score starts at zero, and is increased whenever two tiles combine, by the value of the new tile. 
As with many arcade games, the user's best score is shown alongside the current score.

The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board, hence the name of the game. After reaching the 2048 tile, players can continue to play (beyond the 2048 tile) to reach higher scores.
When the player has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value), the game ends.

## Game functionality

On top of the necessary *start game* / *new game*, my version includes:

- Undo 
- High score 
- ~~Imitated high score statistics: comparing the current score and high score of the session to other users records.~~

**Game control option are:**
- Keyboard arrows 
- On-screen arrow buttons 
- Screen swipe for touch-screen devices. 

# Technologies used:

*HTML* and *CSS* used for the look and feel of the game, including **Bootswatch Cyborg theme**. Besides the built in responsive functionality
of bootstrap, I used further media queries, javaScript to identify landscape/portrait format as well as sass to generate more appropriate 
size variants. I also used sass to generate the colour scheme for the game tiles as well as the style attributes for the tile positioning classes.  

The gameplay functionality was developed in *JavaScript*. 

I used *Stackoverflow* and *w3schools.com* to help me better understand certain JavaScript functionalities and overcome obstacles as 
well as fix bugs.  Advice from Code Institute Slack community has also helped me to learn about debugging in JavaScript. 

# Detail how the project was developed:

At first I concentrated on the maths part of the game and started with a simple grid where I calculated the value of each position of the grid
whenever the user indicated a move. I got stuck with emulating the moves, numbers were changing on the position, but I realised I had 
to use actual tiles and have them sliding on user input. 

Then I implemented the tiles and re-coded the controls. This solution works with two particular classes assigned to each tiles. 
One determines the look and feel of it (colour, font size, font colour), the second sets the position. 

Instead of writing separate functions for moving to each directions I decided to pass the direction as an argument to the the function
that handles the swipe. 

In order to manage the undoing of the last moves, the status of the game board and the current score are recorded to respective arrays
before the actual move takes place. Once the user clicks the undo button, the last element is read from both arrays and the previous 
board state and score are reset accordingly. The length of the arrays storing game play and score history is limited, as there can be 
several thousand moves in a single game play. 

At a certain point in the development there was a bug causing two tiles appearing at the same board position. In order to find the 
cause of the problem I inserted a function to determine when that happened. I decided to leave it in the final version, just in case, 
although the bug has been eliminated.
